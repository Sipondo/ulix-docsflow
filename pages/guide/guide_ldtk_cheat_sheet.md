## The LDTK Cheat Sheet
LDTK as a piece of software has a lot of functionality and it can take a while to become fluent with it.
You will have to use keyboard shortcuts for some of it's functionality. Luckily, there is a shortcut for opening up a concise help page. Pressing H will toggle the cheat sheet, which contains most if not all of the important shortcuts.
