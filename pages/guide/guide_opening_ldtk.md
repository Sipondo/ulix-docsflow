## Opening LDTK
Opening LDTK will greet you with the welcome screen. It will look something like this:
{% include image.html file="opening_ldtk.png" alt="LDTK screenshot" max-width=800 %}

You will be able to quickly navigate old projects via the Recent projects and Recent folders lists. However, as this is the first time we're using the software, you should load the world file manually.

{% include image.html file="filesystem_world_root.png" alt="World root folder" max-width=800 %}

Navigate to the `world` folder inside your project and select the `world.ldtk` file inside. The world will now load.


{% include links.html %}
